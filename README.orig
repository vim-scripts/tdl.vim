Copy tdl.vim to the `runtimepath/syntax' directory. Add the following line to
the `runtimepath/filetype.vim' file:
	au BufNewFile,BufRead *.tdl             setf tdl
Wanna highlighting of a target language in your tree definition file, yeah? Add
line like this to your .vimrc:
	let treedl_target_language = "java"
Currently "java" and "csharp" are supported.
